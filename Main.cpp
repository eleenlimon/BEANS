// Project Two: AirGead Banking Application
// Developer: Eleen Limon
//This program allows users for a bank app to calculate investment growth over time
// with monthly deposits. It provides a screen to input initial investment amount,
// monthly deposit, annual interest rate (compounded), and the number of years for
// the investment to grow. Users can view their input data and proceed to calculate
// the investment's balance and interest earned.


#include "Menu.h"  // Include the Menu header file for accessing menu functions
#include "Bank.h"  // Include the Bank header file for banking functionality


int main() {
    Menu();        // Call the Menu function to start the banking application
    return 0;        // Return 0 to indicate successful execution of the program
}
